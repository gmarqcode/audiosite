        <p>There are many players that you can use to listen to music. I prefer using Minidiscs and CD players.</p>
        <p>Minidiscs are a format created by Sony that committed audio to a 4 inch disc with a hard shell. This could hold about an albums worth of music in a small form factor, so its good for on the go listening.</p>
        <p>CDs are a little bigger than minidisc, but are more consistent with audio playback. They are the industry standard for music playback.</p>

        <p>There are many other players that you can use to listen to music. Cassettes and record players are also a good choice.</p>
        <p>Cassettes are good for bringing your music with you, but having multiple cassettes just to listen to different artists throughout your day is a bit cumbersome.</p>
        <p>Likewise, vinyl records are good for if you want to play your music in the background and have it be secondary to your activities. They also provide a higher quality analog listening experience</p>
